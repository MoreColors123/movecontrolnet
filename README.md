# movecontrolnet - two handy tampermonkey scripts for changing your Stable Diffusion webUI (in a pretty hacky way):

A. cnaboveimages.js: moves the controlnet-tab _above the image results_

B. cninbetween.js: moves the controlnet-tab _between the settings and the image results_


- Works in txt2img and img2img-tab
- Tested with Firefox Tampermonkey extension and Stable Diffusion repos automatic1111, vladmandic and anapnoe. 
- If it doesn't work, its likely due to ad blockers or similar extensions. 

# Installation:
1. Install Tampermonkey
2. View the scriptfile and click the Raw button at the top of the file to view its source
3. Copy the source
4. Open Tampermonkey in your browser and add a script
5. Paste the source into the script window and hit save.
6. Run your browser / start the webui
