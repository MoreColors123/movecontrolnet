# movecontrolnet - two handy tampermonkey scripts if you want to change your Stable Diffusion webUI in a hacky way:

A. cnaboveimages.js moves the controlnet-tab **above the image results** 

B. cninbetween.js moves the controlnet-tab **between the settings and the image results**


- Works in txt2img and img2img-tab
- Tested with Firefox Tampermonkey extension and Stable Diffusion repos automatic1111, vladmandic and anapnoe. 
- If it doesn't work, its likely due to ad blockers or similar extensions. 

# Installation:

4. Open Tampermonkey in your browser and add a script

6. Run your browser / start the webui
