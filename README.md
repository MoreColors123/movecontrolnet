# movecontrolnet
Moves the controlnet-tab above the image results in txt2image and img2img of Stable Diffusion repos "Automatic1111" and "Vladmandic Repo"

Installation:
1. Install Tampermonkey
2. View the scriptfile and click the Raw button at the top of the file to view its source
3. Copy the source
4. Open Tampermonkey in your browser and add a script
5. Paste the source into the script window and hit save.
6. Run your browser

Works in Firefox for me. If it doesn't work, its likely due to ad blockers or similar extensions.
